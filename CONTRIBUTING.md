# Contributing to Open Hotel

We really appreciate the effort from those who are willing to contribute to this project.
The objective of this guideline is to provide a clear explanation of how the project works
and how you can help us on making it better.

#### [Open Hotel Client](https://github.com/open-hotel/open-hotel-client)

This is the client repository. It is responsible for handling sprites and game logic
using [PIXI.js](https://www.pixijs.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

The Codebase is written in TypeScript, and we use [injets](https://github.com/open-hotel/injets)
as our dependency injection library.

#### [Orion Emulator](https://github.com/open-hotel/orion-emulator)

Orion is responsible for handling back-end stuff.
We have to make sure all players are synced up, so that's the main Orion's purpose.
